# Nabla: Revolutionizing Medical Documentation with AI

## Overview and Origin

* Company Name: Nabla Copilot
  
* Incorporation: Nabla was founded in 2018.
  
* Founders: Nabla was founded by Alexandre Lebrun (CEO), Delphine Groll (COO), and
Martin Raison (CTO).

* Idea for the Company: Nabla was founded with the idea of reducing the administrative
burden of medical documentation. The process was inefficient as it caused distractions in
doctors trying to multitask and human errors when annotating a conversation with a
patient. Nabla founders saw an opportunity to use [NLP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/natural-language-processing-nlp/#:~:text=Natural%20language%20processing%20(NLP)%20is,of%20the%20meaning%20of%20language.) (Natural Language Processing) to
automate the note-taking process and improve patient care.

* Funding: Nabla received a series B funding in January of 2024 from Cathay Innovation
and Zebox for a value of $24M.

## Business Activities

* Problem being Solved: Doctors who take manual notes of their meetings with patients are
not using their time and resources efficiently. They are more likely to be distracted and
miss key details, are less likely to engage with the patient, and are on a path to burnout.
According to prnewswire.com, “clinical documentation is a time-sensitive task that adds six
hours per week of EHR (Electronic Health Record) work for practitioners outside of
standard time spent with patients”.

* Intended Customer: The intended customers for Nabla are healthcare providers.
According to Nabla.com, it “works in all settings: patients and caregivers, outpatient and
inpatient, and telehealth encounters”. Nabla offers multiple customizable templates,
making it ideal for any practitioner from any field to summarize their interactions in a way
that will reflect their needs and style.

* Solution Offered: Nabla identifies the administrative problem and solves it by creating an
automated note-taking system that uses NLP technology to transcribe and summarize
doctor-patient interactions in real time.

* Current Technologies Used: Nabla is a complete [AI](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=Cloudflare%20for%20AI%20allows%20developers,on%20the%20Cloudflare%20global%20network.)(Artificial Intelligence) assistant that offers clinical notes,
decision prompting, patient summaries, medical codification, EHR integration, and precharting.
“It supports direct API integration with the tech stack you already use, whether through existing
partnerships with EHRs and telehealth solutions or direct integration with proprietary software”
(Nabla.com).

   Given the sensitive nature of healthcare, Nabla places a strong emphasis on data privacy
and security. To ensure high protection, Nabla never stores user data, such as audio and
transcripts, beyond the moment needed to generate summaries. They adhere to HIPAA and
GDPR standards through an external [API](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/api/what-is-an-api/#:~:text=An%20application%20programming%20interface%20(API)%20is%20a%20set%20of%20rules,data%20to%20another%20software%20program.) and are committed to never selling data or
training their models using patient information.
 > “All stored transcripts and notes are
protected with two layers of encryption (system and application), using strong
cryptography standards. This data processing is done on Nabla's infrastructure in Google
Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure, in strict compliance with both HIPAA and GDPR.
To make sure patient data is never stored outside our control, we also have agreements to
opt out of data retention for all services used to process it.” (Nabla.com)

## Landscape

* Field: Nabla functions in the AI in healthcare field.
  
* Major Field Trends: In the past 5 to 10 years, there has been a major shift towards the use
of AI in healthcare. We have started to see an increase in telehealth, which boomed during
COVID-19 where patients could have consultations through video calls. There is also an
increase in AI powered tools to help diagnose and treat patients. This technology can
analyze symptoms, images, test results, medical history and other components to help
diagnose patients. It has also been used for early detection of some diseases that the human
eye will not catch.

   According to PwC, the AI Market for Healthcare Applications has grown from 663.8 million
in 2014 to 6,662 million in 2021. They also explain the different technology that has been
used over the years and how it has evolved. One decade ago, the industry was focused on
medical products which included equipment, hardware, and consumables. The focus was
on the innovation of products. In the current decade, the industry is focused on medical
platforms which includes wearables, big data, and health analytics. The focus is on
providing services to key stakeholders and on real-time outcomes. They predict that the
future decade will focus on medical solutions through robotics, AI, and Augmented Reality.
They predict the focus will be on preventative care and intelligent solutions. (PwC.com)

   We have already entered the “future decade” that PwC describes, and AI has started to take
over the old ways of healthcare. As AI continues to evolve, these trends will only deepen
and will create a more customized approach to healthcare.

* Competitors: Other major companies that operate in the AI in healthcare field are
Microsoft and Google. Microsoft states they are “bridging data, AI, and trust across the
entire healthcare ecosystem” through providers, payers and insurers, and life sciences.
Some of the products they offer for healthcare are Microsoft Fabric, Power Platform,
Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, Azure AI, and Nuance DAX Copilot. Microsoft’s integration
with AI tools in its cloud platform, Azure, allows healthcare providers to analyze patient
data, manage health records, and use predictive analysis. Nuance DAX Copilot is their
version of NLP which transcribes doctor-patient interactions, like Nabla. Unlike Nabla,
Microsoft does not mention any commitment to not storing patient data.

   Google on the other hand has a division called Google Health that focuses on advancing
healthcare through AI. They have multiple tools and products that use AI for multiple areas
of healthcare. Google’s Med-PAlm used NLP to analyze medical text and help professionals
in decision-making. DeepMind Health is another application that helps providers with early
disease detection. They also have an application called Google Health Care Studio, which
like Nabla, helps providers with efficient documentation and data management.

## Results

* Business Impact: Nabla has made a significant impact on the administrative tasks portion
of healthcare, reducing the time and resources needed for patient documentation. Nabla
has been integrated into 40+ healthcare organizations and has been used by 30,000+
clinicians. Their ability to integrate into existing systems has aided them in being
recognized and used by so many healthcare organizations.

* Core Metrics: Some core metrics that can be used to measure Nabla’s success are the
accuracy of the documentation process, the reduction in time spent on documenting, and
the user adoption rates. The accuracy of the documentation process measures how well the
technology is capturing and analyzing data, making as few mistakes as possible. The
technology should capture words properly and be able to interpret and summarize
conversations and organize the data. The reduction in time spent on documentation
measures how much time healthcare providers can save by not taking notes manually. This
can be measured by how much time a doctor saves with each patient interaction and 
finding the average time saved in the entire organization. Finally, the user adoption rates
measure the extent to which healthcare providers are using this product. If the product is
being adopted quickly, it means the product is working and meeting their needs. Nabla is
scoring high on all three metrics and has received great feedback indicating the previously
mentioned.

* Performance: Nabla is a smaller company than Microsoft or Google, but it is being used
and recognized in the healthcare industry. Unlike the other larger companies, Nabla
focuses only on NLP and excels at it. While other companies focus on multiple products, Nabla
has a Niche market, ensuring their excellence. Even though they have strong competitors,
their focus on data privacy and security has allowed them to position themselves as a
unique competitor.

## Recommendations

* Recommended Products/Services: If I were to advise Nabla on a new product or service, I
would suggest enhancing the platform to create personalized decision-making for
diagnosis and medication. Once the platform has transcribed the doctor-patient interaction
and has created an organized sheet of data, the system can make suggestions on a diagnosis
and respective medication. Even though the doctor will have the final say and can override
the suggestion given by Nabla, it would help the doctor with decision making. Nabla could
suggest a list of diagnoses and medications that the doctor may have overseen or forgotten
to consider. This would make the entire process more thorough.

* Recommended product/Service Benefits: On top of making the documentation process
more thorough, this product could reduce the possibility of human error by ensuring the
healthcare provider has considered all possibilities. It could also serve as decision-making
support as it will offer informed, educated, and evidence-based suggestions. If a case has
multiple possible diagnosis, the system suggests the most likely match of diagnosis based
on statistics. For those providers who are less experienced, this technology could aid them
not only to remember more information, but as a learning tool. This enhancement to their
already existing product would help them position themselves as a leader in the AI in the
healthcare industry.

* Recommended Product/Services Technologies: Beyond the NLP technology it already
uses to automate documentation, it would also use [machine learning](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-machine-learning/) and [deep learning](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-deep-learning/#:~:text=Deep%20learning%20is%20a%20powerful,for%20many%20types%20of%20AI.).
This would be used to analyze the data and generate suggestions. The model would be
trained on a large dataset to identify patterns. The datasets would be stored in cloud
computing platforms where it is cross-referenced with the documentation, but the 
documentation would not be stored in the cloud. ML and DL are appropriate for this
suggestion due to their ability to learn from large datasets which is important for accurate
diagnosis.
